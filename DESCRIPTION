Title: Spatial Reconstruction of Tissues from scRNA-seq Data

Description: While single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) provides biological insights
    at the single cell resolution, dissociation of cells from tissues is
    required for this procedure, thereby destroying spatial context of cells and
    gene expression. Various methods have been devised to reconstruct the lost
    spatial context by integrating scRNA-seq data and an in situ atlas that has
    spatial information but for fewer landmark genes. This package is based on
    the method developed in the biorxiv paper Charting a tissue from single-cell 
    transcriptomes by Nitzan et al., 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1101/456350), 
    which uses optimal transport to reconstruct the spatial context with or 
    without an in situ atlas. This method is called de novo Spatial 
    Reconstruction (novoSpaRc), and is originally implemented in Python by the
    authors of the paper. This package is an R implementation of novoSpaRc.
